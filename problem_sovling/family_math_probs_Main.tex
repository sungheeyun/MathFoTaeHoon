\section{Jisun's pizze problem (21-MAR-2020)}

While we were chatting over \href{https://zoom.us/}{Zoom} on 21-MAR-2020,
Jisun brought up the below problem:
\begin{quote}
Suppose that you have a round pizza and an analog watch or clock.
How can you divide it into 11 (exactly) equal pieces?
\end{quote}
Though this problem looked really interesting,
I myself could not figure it out.
Taehoon said you can erase the digit $12$,
which was a very creative idea.
However, nobody could give the correct question to it.

On 23-MAR-2020, Jisun asked again, ``Has anybody solved the pizza problem?'' over KakaoTalk.
I googled it and found the following answer.

\end{center}

And Jisun confirmed that that is the right answer.

Then my tendency to want to prove things rigorously
made me have to spend my time on writing the below.
However, I'm pretty sure that this will be helpful for my nephews (and niece),
so this would definitely not waste of time. :) 


Here I want to write two different ways to see this, the first of which is kind of repeat what is written above.

\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
One way to prove this can go as follows.

If you position the hour hand (HH) and the minute hand (MH) at noon
and let the watch operator as it usually does,
then the two hands do not meet until 1PM (the left clock in \figurename~\ref{fig:1})
because the MH goes faster than the HH.
Now if the time passes a bit more,
there comes a moment that the two hands meets exactly (the right clock in \figurename~\ref{fig:1}).
Now mark this position (or angle) on the pizza.
Then wait until the two hands meet again and mark that position, too.
You repeat this until the two meets again at midnight.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{figures/pizza_HH_MH}
\end{center}
\caption{The locations of hour and minute hands at 1PM (left) and those when it meets the next time (right).}
\label{fig:1}
\end{figure}

Now ask how many times the two hands have met after noon, \ie,
exclude noon.
Since they met a bit after 1PM, then a more bit after 2PM, \ldots,
and after 11PM. When they met after 11PM is at midnight.
Thus, \emph{they have met 11 times}.

Because you can insist that the time between two consecutive \emph{rendezvious} of the two hands is the same for every time,
this divides $360$ degrees into 11 equal angles.


\item
Now let us examine this quantitatively.
Let $x$ be the angle between HH at midnight and HH when it meets MH next time as shown in \figurename~\ref{fig:2}.
Because HH goes to the position of $1$
when MH does one rotation,
\ie, the speed of MH is $12$ times faster then HH,
the angle $y$ in \figurename~\ref{fig:2} is $12$ times smaller than $x$,
or equivalently, $x$ is $12$ times larger than $y$.
Then we have
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1}
x = 12 \times y.
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.4\linewidth]{figures/pizza_HH_MH_angles}
\end{center}
\caption{Pizza problem: $x$ refers to the angle between $12$ o'clock and where the minute hand meets the hour hand,
and $y$ refers to the angle between $1$ o'clock and where the minute hand meets the hour hand.}
\label{fig:2}
\end{figure}

Now we have two variables, $x$ and $y$, but only one equation. In this case, (in general) we cannot decide
unique values for the variables.
However, we have one more equation
since $x$ is equal to $y$ plus $360/12$.
Therefore we have
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2}
x = y + \frac{360}{12}
\Leftrightarrow
12 \times x = 12 \times y + 360
\end{equation}
We obtained the right side equality
by multiplying $12$ on both sides of the left equality in (\ref{eq:2}).
Now if you replace $12\times y$ with $x$ in (\ref{eq:1}),
we obtain
\begin{equation}
12 \times x = x + 360
\Leftrightarrow
11 \times x = 360
\Leftrightarrow
x = 360/11.
\end{equation}
Therefore our method \emph{indeed} divides the pizza into $11$ equal-sized pieces.
\qed

An interesting observation is that this number $11$ comes from the calculation of $12 - 1$.
Thus, if half day were $13$ hours, the technique would give us $12$ pizza pieces,
and, \eg, if half day were $18$ hours, the technique would give us $17$ pizza pieces.
In general, if half day were $n$ hours, the technique would give us $n-1$ pizze pieces!
This type of generalization is a good practice to improve your math skills (\emph{I} believe).

\end{enumerate}

\end{proof}
