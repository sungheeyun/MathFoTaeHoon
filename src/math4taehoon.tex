\item What is the smallest possible value of $n$ that makes $7! \times n$ a perfect square?

{\bf Answer}: $35$

\begin{proof}
Since
\begin{equation}
7! = 2 \times 3 \times (2 \times 2 ) \times 5 \times (2\times 3) \times 7
=  2^4 \times 3^2 \times 5 \times 7
=  (2^2 \times 3)^2 \times 5 \times 7,
\end{equation}
we need at least one $5$ and one $7$ to make $7!\times n$ a perfect square.
Therefore the smallest possible value of $n$ that makes $7! \times n$ a perfect square
is $5\times 7 = 35$.
Note that $7! \times 35 = (2^2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7)^2$.

\end{proof}

\item If there are 18 dragons with either $2$ or $3$ heads,
and the total number of heads is $42$,
how many $2$-headed dragons are there? 

{\bf Answer}: $12$

\begin{proof}
Let $x$ be the number of $2$-headed dragons
and
$y$ be the number of $3$-headed dragons.
Since there are $18$ dragons, we have the following equation:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dfihj}
x + y = 18
\end{equation}
Also, the total number of heads is $42$, thus we have
\begin{equation}
2 \times x + 3 \times y = 42
\end{equation}

Now if we multiply $3$ to both the left-hand-side (LHS) and right-hand-side (RHS) of (\ref{eq:dfihj}),
we obtain the following two equations:
\begin{eqnarray}
3\times x + 3\times y &=& 3\times(x+y) = 3\times 18
\label{eq:oges}
\\
2 \times x + 3 \times y &=& 42
\label{eq:uydh}
\end{eqnarray}

Now we subtract (\ref{eq:uydh}) from (\ref{eq:oges}), we get
\begin{equation}
x = (3\times x + 3\times y) - (2 \times x + 3 \times) =  3 \times 18 - 42 = 54 - 42 = 12.
\end{equation}
Since we initially assumed that $x$ is the number of $2$-headed dragons,
the answer is $12$.
\end{proof}


\item Brenda and Sally run in opposite directions on a circular track,
starting at diametrically opposite points.
They first meet after Brenda has run $100$ meters.
They next meet after Sally has run $150$ meters past their first meeting point.
Each girl runs at a constant speed.
What is the length of the track in meters?

{\bf Answer}: $350$ meters.

\begin{proof}
\figurename~\ref{fig:race} shows the track Brenda and Sally run.
$X$ refers to the distance that Sally runs until she meets Brenda
and $Y$ refers to the distance that Brenda runs past the first meeting point until she meets Sally again.
Now since they run at constant speed,
the ratio of $100$ to $X$ and that of $Y$ to $150$ are the same,
\ie,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bysio}
100 : X = Y : 150
\Leftrightarrow
\frac{100}{X} = \frac{Y}{150}
\Leftrightarrow
X \times Y = 100 \times 150.
\end{equation}
Now we know that the sum of the distance that Brenda runs and the distance that Sally runs until they first meet
is half the circumference of the track.
We also know that the sum of the distance that Brenda runs and the distance that Sally runs
until they meets second time is the circumference of the track.
If we express this as an equation, we have
\begin{equation}
Y + 150 = 2 \times (X + 100).
\end{equation}
Now if we multiply $2$ to both side of this equation and use (\ref{eq:bysio}),
we have
\begin{eqnarray*}
&& X \times Y + 150 \times X = 2 \times (X \times X + 100 \times X)
\\
&\Leftrightarrow&
100 \times 150 + 150 \times X = 2 \times (X \times X + 100 \times X)
\\
&\Leftrightarrow&
X\times X + 25 \times X  - 100 \times 75 = 0
\\
&\Leftrightarrow&
(X - 75) \times (X + 100) = 0.
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore $X=75$ and the circumference (or the length) of the track
is $2\times (X+100) = 350$.
